YOLO-based Object Detection System

This project implements a real-time object detection system using the YOLOv8 architecture. The system is capable of detecting and classifying multiple objects in images and video streams with high accuracy and speed.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Built with YOLOv8 for state-of-the-art object detection.

Supports real-time detection on images, video files, and live webcam feeds.

Trained on a custom dataset with extensive data augmentation for better generalization.

Optimized inference pipeline for high FPS performance on CPU and GPU.

Integrated with OpenCV for visualization (bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores).

Modular and easy-to-extend codebase for adapting to new datasets or deployment environments.
